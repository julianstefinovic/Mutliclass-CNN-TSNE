Convolutional Neural Network & Autoencoder Training with projection of latent spaces into 2D planes

File 1 (training_autoencoder.ipynb) contains training for a 2D Convolutional Autoencoder and projecting the latent vectors into 2D with T-SNE

File 2 (training_classify.ipynb) contains training for a 2D Convolutional Neural Network in a classification setting and projecting the penultimate linear layer to 2D space via T-SNE.
